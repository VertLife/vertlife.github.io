Downloading whole tree distributions
====================================

The phylogeny is available to download as either archives of complete trees (below) or by subsetting to a user provided set of species using the tool on the right.

There are four choices of class-wide tree distribution to choose from, each containing 10K trees, stored as zip archives of 1K trees each. Full details of each tree distribution are available in the supplementary material.

[Full trees (9993 species), Hackett backbone](http://birdtree.org/bird-tree/archives/Stage2/)

[Full trees (9993 species), Ericson backone ](http://birdtree.org/bird-tree/archives/Stage2/)

[Genetic data only trees (6670 species), Hackett backbone](http://birdtree.org/bird-tree/archives/Stage1/)
