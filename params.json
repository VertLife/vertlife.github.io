For additional information about the integration approach and the evaluations of the datasets, please see the associated journal article:\r\n\r\nTuanmu, M.-N. and W. Jetz. 2014. A global 1-km consensus land-cover product for biodiversity and ecosystem modeling. Global Ecology and Biogeography, XX: XXX-XXX.\r\n\r\n### Dataset Details\r\n\r\nTwo versions of the consensus land-cover datasets are available. The first version is the dataset integrating GlobCover (2005-06; v2.2), the MODIS land-cover product (MCD12Q1; v051), GLC2000 (global product; v1.1), and DISCover (GLCC; v2). The second version is the dataset integrating the first three products only (i.e., without DISCover).\r\n\r\nEach dataset contains 12 data layers, each of which provides consensus information on the prevalence of one land-cover class. All data layers contain unsigned 8-bit values and the valid values range from 0-100, representing the consensus prevalence in percentage. All data layers have a spatial extent from 90ºN - 56ºS and from 180ºW - 180ºE, and have a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second per pixel (~1 km per pixel at the equator).\r\n\r\nThe 12 land-cover classes are:\r\n* Class 1 – Evergreen/Deciduous Needleleaf Trees\r\n* Class 2 – Evergreen Broadleaf Trees\r\n* Class 3 – Deciduous Broadleaf Trees\r\n* Class 4 – Mixed/Other Trees\r\n* Class 5 – Shrubs\r\n* Class 6 – Herbaceous Vegetation\r\n* Class 7 – Cultivated and Managed Vegetation (including a mixture with natural vegetation)\r\n* Class 8 – Regularly Flooded Vegetation\r\n* Class 9 – Urban/Built-up\r\n* Class 10 – Snow/Ice\r\n* Class 11 – Barren\r\n* Class 12 – Open Water\r\n\r\n### Dataset Download\r\n\r\n**Version 1 (with DISCover)**\r\n\r\nAll land-cover classes\r\n\r\n* Class 1\r\n* Class 2\r\n* Class 3\r\n* Class 4\r\n* Class 5\r\n* Class 6\r\n* Class 7\r\n* Class 8\r\n* Class 9\r\n* Class 10\r\n* Class 11\r\n* Class 12\r\n\r\n**Version 2 (without DISCover)**\r\n\r\nAll land-cover classes\r\n\r\n* Class 1\r\n* Class 2\r\n* Class 3\r\n* Class 4\r\n* Class 5\r\n* Class 6\r\n* Class 7\r\n* Class 8\r\n* Class 9\r\n* Class 10\r\n* Class 11\r\n* Class 12\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nAlthough DISCover is based on older remote sensing imagery (1992-1993), it contains some complementary information which is useful for capturing sub-pixel land cover heterogeneity (please see the associated article for details). Therefore, it is recommended to use the first version of the consensus land cover dataset for most applications. However, the second version may provide an alternative for applications in regions with large land cover change in the past two decades.\r\n\r\n### Dataset Citation\r\n\r\nTuanmu, M.-N. and W.
