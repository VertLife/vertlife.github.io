## Ecological causes of uneven diversification and richness in the mammal tree of life

#### **Significance statement**
The over 6000 living species in the mammalian tree of life are clustered unevenly among branches so that similarly aged groups sometimes differ many fold in modern richness (e.g., ~2500 rodent species versus 8 pangolins). Why differential bursts of species diversification occur, and how long they persist, has implications for sustaining biodiversity. Here we develop a robust evolutionary timescale for most extant species, recovering signatures of rate-variable diversification linked to ecological factors. Mammals with low dispersal or that are day-active show the fastest recent diversification, consistent with mechanisms of allopatric speciation and ecological opportunity, respectively. Speciation rates are surprisingly faster in extra-tropical than tropical lineages, suggesting that longer durations for tropical lineages drive the latitudinal diversity gradient in mammals.

#### **Links to MCC consensus trees of the DNA-only distributions:**   
   **USAGE:** Consensus trees are only meaningful on our DNA-only distributions; completed trees are inappropriate for consensus since they contain taxonomically imputed species that vary widely in position across the posterior distribution of trees.

[This subsetter tool](http://vertlife.org/phylosubsets/){:target="_blank"} will publish the full tree distributions, including the Completed trees of 5911 species, along with the article. Note that the manuscript is in review; trees are not yet published and remain under embargo.
