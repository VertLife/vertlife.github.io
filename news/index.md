	Jetz and co-corresponding author R. Alexander Pyron of George Washington constructed the first comprehensive family tree for nearly all amphibious species alive today. The researchers used the data to examine historical diversification patterns of amphibians as well as species’ level of isolation on the family tree, also called evolutionary distinctness.

  A Yale-led effort to bring “big data” to the study of biodiversity has received a $2.5 million boost, courtesy of the National Science Foundation. The grant is part of a new, Genealogy of Life program at the NSF, and will be used to create annotated family trees, computational tools, and a digital database addressing all terrestrial vertebrates.
