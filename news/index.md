- [Mammal tree figure wins art prize](https://jetzlab.yale.edu/news/nathan-upham-announced-winner-art-research-competition) - June 12, 2019
	
	The winning image summarizes the tempo and relationships of evolutionary history across 5,911 species of living and recently extinct mammals globally, as reconstructed from DNA and fossil information. It forms figure 1 of a forthcoming publication by Upham, Esselstyn, and Jetz, which is currently available as a [pre-print on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/504803v2).
		
- [VertLife Phylogeny Subsetter](https://vertlife.org/phylosubsets/) - April 2, 2018
	
	In addition to the Bird Tree and Shark Tree, a generalized phylogeny subsetter tool is now available for Amphibians, Birds, Sharks, and Squamates! Check it out [here](https://vertlife.org/phylosubsets/) and provide us with [feedback](mailto:support@vertlife.org).

- [Human threats to the amphibian tree of life](https://news.yale.edu/2018/03/26/human-threats-amphibian-tree-life) - March 26, 2018
	
	Jetz of Yale and co-corresponding author Pyron of George Washington constructed the first comprehensive family tree for nearly all amphibious species alive today. The researchers used the data to examine historical diversification patterns of amphibians as well as species’ level of isolation on the family tree, also called evolutionary distinctness.

  A Yale-led effort to bring “big data” to the study of biodiversity has received a $2.5 million boost, courtesy of the National Science Foundation. The grant is part of a new, Genealogy of Life program at the NSF, and will be used to create annotated family trees, computational tools, and a digital database addressing all terrestrial vertebrates.
